## Operations
The shape calculation web application will use 2 form fields (shape name and length), to calculate the area and perimeter of a shape. 

To begin testing this web app, the user must firstly open their project folder 'django-shape-calc-web-app', using a text editor such as Visual Studio Code. Next, the user must run localhost on their web server, using the correct command from their terminal. Once the web server has started, they can then open the file template input.html using a web browser like Google Chrome. 

The input file template inherits HTML markup from it's parent template named shapeform. This process is known as Template Inheritance and is a common practice for all Model View Template (MVT) web app projects. Furthermore, this extended template replaces (overrides) the existing block named content from the parent template.

The view named index renders the first request made to the server. It then displays the input template content to the default web page. This is the first web page that is displayed, once the user visits the website. It features a shape form which the user must complete, before they can calculate the area and perimeter of a shape.

The user can begin a calculation by firstly selecting a shape name option from the drop-down menu. The menu options are: square, triangle (equilateral) and circle. In addition, the user must enter an integer (whole number) into the subsequent number field. This will be the length metric used for both calculations. The user's web browser may also provide stepper arrows for this field. This feature lets the user maximise or minimize the length value. The length metric must be within the pre-defined interval of 1 - 100 cm and cannot be a decimal. Once the user is satisfied with their form data entries, they can then proceed with the calculation by selecting the submit button.

Once the form data entries are submitted as a post request, the calculations are then processed. Finally, the view named checkShape will render the request and return the results from both calculations to the other child template named result.

Both child templates also insert header, footer and style templates within their blocks named content.

Each text input field is set to read only, so the results cannot be modified.

Below the shape measurement results, there is also a link named 'Return', which takes the user back to the shape form.
